			<div class="projectcontainer">
				<a class="project" href="https://flagrank.moctave.net">
					<img src="resources/img/thumb-flagrank.png" alt="Flagrank's icon."/>
					<div class="projectbody"><h2>Flagrank</h2><p>Have you ever felt personally offended by a bad flag design? Sat down and spent hours of your life trying to build a tier flaglist? Watched that one CGP Grey video on loop? Well, here's the site for you. Pit flags against each other in an infinite series of head-to-head matches and let your (clearly superior) opinions on vexillology influence the flags' online Elo ratings in real time.</p></div>
				</a>
				<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/weftspace">
					<img src="resources/img/thumb-weftspace.png" alt="Weftspace's icon"/>
					<div class="projectbody"><h2>Weftspace</h2><p>Weftspace is my library designed to offer the maximum possible level of support for Endless Sky datafile syntax. I maintain versions of the library for both Java and Python, and am currently working on transitioning to a test-driven development model for the project.</p></div></a>
				<a class="project" href="projects/270-50.html">
					<img src="resources/img/thumb-270-50.png" alt="270-50's icon"/>
					<div class="projectbody"><h2>270-50</h2><p>A fun little CLI game where you can compete against a bot or a fellow human being to bribe large quantities of people into voting for you.</p></div>
				</a>
				<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/blended-ships">
					<img src="resources/img/thumb-blended-ships.png" alt="Blended Ships' icon"/>
					<div class="projectbody"><h2>Blended Ships</h2><p>Blended Ships is by far my largest and most polished ES plugin, attempting to introduce some element of realism (sorry Azure) into ship splicing.</p></div>
				</a>
				<a class="project" href="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky">
					<img src="resources/img/thumb-es.png" alt="Endless Sky's icon"/>
					<div class="projectbody"><h2>Endless Sky</h2><p>Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. I do content review for the game when I have time, and also have a number of plugins and development tools for it, many of which are on this page.</p></div>
				</a>
				<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/eratosthenes-benchmark">
					<img src="resources/img/thumb-eratosthenes.png" alt="Eratosthenes Benchmark' icon"/>
					<div class="projectbody"><h2>Eratosthenes Benchmark</h2><p>An old project of mine where I benchmarked different programming languages and tried to learn a bit more about them in the process. As far as I'm aware, all the code there still should work, and you're welcome to PR another language. However, I'm not actively working on this anymore.</p></div>
				</a>
				<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/mapgen">
					<img src="resources/img/thumb-mapgen.png" alt="ES Map Generator's icon"/>
					<div class="projectbody"><h2>Endless Sky Map Generator</h2><p>At some point in 2023 I decided that Endless Sky's map needed an update, and so I pieced together a new map out of a whole bunch of screenshots. Fast forward a year and I got fed up with spending so much time doing such repetitive work, and so I made a tool to generate more professional-looking betterer maps automatically.</p></div>
				</a>
				<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/grapher">
					<img src="resources/img/thumb-grapher.png" alt="Grapher's icon."/>
					<div class="projectbody"><h2>Grapher</h2><p>An exercise in systematic design I put myself through between May 2024 and March 2025. It is a functional graphing calculator, capable of plotting two different kinds of trendline and custom error bars, and works with a custom binary file format. Considered finished, no longer maintained.</p></div>
				</a>
				<a class="project" href="https://moctave.github.io/es-community-directory/">
					<img src="resources/img/thumb-directory.png" alt="ES Directory's icon"/>
					<div class="projectbody"><h2>ES Community Directory</h2><p>My attempt to provide a community directory of everyone involved in Endless Sky. Now maintained with the help of a couple other members of the community.</p></div>

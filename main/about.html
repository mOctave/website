				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I'm an amateur programmer and copyeditor who values quality, human community-driven development. I enjoy taking a problem, overcomplicating it, and then picking the nits out of it until I get a polished, professional product. Although I have no official credentials (yet), I've been coding most of my life by this point and would consider myself an intermediate developer according to the <a href="https://github.com/Semalab/developer-skills-matrix/blob/main/rubric/rubric.md">Developer Skills Matrix</a>.</p>
				<p>These days, I prefer to work in Java, although I also have a fair amount of experience in Python and Inform 7, spend far too much of my time doing web development, and I've dabbled in languages ranging from SQL and C++ to Intercal and assembly.</p>
				<p>I've personally always enjoyed both the pursuit of excellence and gaining in-depth understanding of what I'm working with. Perhaps this is why I like strong typing and dislike vibe coding; I'd rather know exactly what I've written and have absolute confidence that it works because I've written the tests for it and it will fail fast and hard if anything goes wrong. Over the past couple of years, I've begun to appreciate elements of a systematic design approach, and I've recently been enjoying applying a test-driven development approach to projects like <a href="https://github.com/moctave/weftspace">Weftspace</a>.</p>
				<p>Rather than focus on simply writing libraries or making apps, I enjoy doing both: I've created user-facing programs such as <a href="https://flagrank.moctave.net">Flagrank</a>, programmer-focused tools like <a href="https://github.com/moctave/mapgen">my ES Map Generator</a>, and backend libraries such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/phrasemaker">Phrasemaker</a>, and I hope to be able to continue to work on a range of projects in the future.</p>
				<p>Beyond programming, I am also involved in the development of the open-source game <a href="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky">Endless Sky</a> as a content reviewer, and I occasionally do 3D modelling work such as for my plugin <a href="https://github.com/mOctave/blended-ships">Blended Ships</a>.</p>
				<p>If you're interested in what I'm doing, you can find me on <a href="https://github.com/mOctave">GitHub</a> or send me an <a href="mailto:moctave31415@gmail.com">email</a>. I'm also sometimes active on the Endless Sky Discord server, so you may be able to track me down there.</p>

				<h1>Paper Cuts</h1>
				<p class="date">20 February 2026</p>
				<p>Last week, I had the opportunity to participate in a hackathon with a couple of great guys I had never met before. Needless to say, we didn't win, but I had a great time and got a whole bunch of experience working in a faster, more cutting-edge development environment than I typically get to.</p>
				<p>For someone who typically avoids using genAI, it was a very interesting experience to be working with people who took it for granted. We had a pretty acceptable AI-generated outline right out of the gate, but it definitely took some fine-tuning. I wouldn't have chosen that kind of approach myself, but it meant I got a crash course in Spring Boot and MongoDB (not to mention a refresher on REST APIs) that I wouldn't have had if I'd just gone in with my prior knowledge. It was both impressive to see how much AI tools had matured in some areas (UI design with Lovable, for example), but also reassuring in a way how much their output still needed to be adjusted by a human who actually understand the goals of the program.</p>
				<p>All that to say, great fun and I'm looking forward to next year! If you want to see what we came up with, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/SzJasonHuang/PaperCuts"> on my teammate's GitHub</a>.</p>

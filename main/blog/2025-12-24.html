			<h1>Blended Ships: Sosumi</h1>
			<p class="date">24 December 2025</p>
			<p>It's another Christmas Eve (in my time zone at least), and you know what that means... another release of Blended Ships!</p>
			<p>This release features three new ships, some relevant missions, news, and hails <em>(gasp! not in my ship plugin)</em>, a number of bug fixes and minor tweaks, improved Omnis support, and a way to legitimately obtain a Navy License.</p>
			<img class="centered-img" src="../resources/img/blog-blended-ships-sosumi.png" alt="A number of my Blended Ships in flight... the banner for the new release."/>
			<p>Thank you to Loymdayddaud/Giraffe for contributing changes to this update, and to everyone else for your encouragement and ideas over the last few years... it's crazy how this plugin is more than three years old now.</p>
			<p>You can get the latest version of the plugin <a href="https://github.com/mOctave/blended-ships/releases">here</a>. It should be available in the official plugin directory as soon as it updates.</p>
			<p>If you find issues or have new ship ideas, please <a href="https://github.com/mOctave/blended-ships/issues">open an issue</a> or ping me on the Endless Sky Discord server.</p>
			<p>I won't promise a release date for 1.4.0, since this release is, uh, eight or nine months behind when I said it was going to be, but I do plan on releasing 1.4.0 <em>sometime</em> next year.</p>
			<p>Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone!</p>

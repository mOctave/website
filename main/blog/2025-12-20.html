			<h1>Flashbang Time</h1>
			<p class="date">20 December 2025</p>
			<p>So, did I say in October that I was sort of happy with this website?</p>
			<p>How very funny of me.</p>
			<p>I decided to give everything (especially the design, goodbye garish background image) a major overhaul, which is still a bit of a work in progress.</p>
			<p>Oh, and of course I decided to flashbang everyone, since the dark mode was beginning to feel just a little too much like a badly-designed dark mode. So now you can look in awe upon a badly-designed light mode instead.</p>
			<p>Anyways, all that to say that now instead of having your eyes bleed from bad design, you can have them bleed from slightly less bad but much brighter design. More changes should be around here soonish, and I may even get down to work writing something her other than a boring post about website changes soon.</p>

				<h1>Taskship: Reborn</h1>
				<p class="date">16 January 2026</p>
				<p>What if people actually looked at your ship and gave you appropriate jobs? What if you could turn a profit using your old Flivver for hauling joyriders up to orbit, or join mock battles in your Osprey to thrill the galaxy's dedicated 31st-century-television-equivalent viewers? Well, now you can.</p>
				<img class="centered-img" src="../resources/img/blog-16-trbanner.png" alt="A number of my Blended Ships in flight... the banner for the new release."/>
				<p>When I first started work on Taskship, it was a proof-of-concept way to soft-balance ships and make traditionally niche options more appealing. Then I expanded it to cover all human ships. And then it sat in a corner collecting dust for two years.</p>
				<p>Now, Taskship is back. With several bug and typo fixes, a new icon, and plans to add more tasks for more ships, this release marks the beginning of what will hopefully be a long run of Taskship releases to come.</p>
				<p>You can get the latest version of the plugin <a href="https://github.com/mOctave/taskship/releases">here</a>. It should also be available in the official plugin directory in a day or two.</p>
				<p>If you find a problem with the plugin or have suggestions of jobs to add, please <a href="https://github.com/mOctave/taskship/issues">open an issue</a> or ping me on the Endless Sky Discord server.</p>
				<p>Enjoy!</p>

			<h1>mOctave</h1>
			<p>Hi! I'm mOctave, an amateur Java developer, Endless Sky reviewer, and ranker of flags. Oh, and I seem to be doing way too much website design these days.</p>
			<p>Here's a couple of things I've done. For a fuller (but still incomplete) list, see my <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>.</p>
			<div class="projectcontainer">
				<a class="project" href="https://flagrank.moctave.net"><div class="projectheader"><img src="https://flagrank.moctave.net/img/icon.svg" alt="Flagrank's icon."/><h2>Flagrank</h2></div><p>Have you ever felt personally offended by a bad flag design? Sat down and spent hours of your life trying to build a tier flaglist? Watched that one CGP Grey video on loop? Well, here's the site for you. Pit flags against each other in an infinite series of head-to-head matches and let your (clearly superior) opinions on vexillology influence the flags' online Elo ratings in real time.</p></a>
				<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/weftspace"><div class="projectheader"><img src="https://moctave.github.io/weftspace/icon.svg" alt="Weftspace's icon"/><h2>Weftspace</h2></div><p>Weftspace is a library designed to offer the maximum possible level of support for Endless Sky datafile syntax. Available and maintained for Java and Python, and useful for providing datafile support for lightweight apps where the structure of a JSON or YAML file isn't quite what you're looking for.</p></a>
				<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/blended-ships"><div class="projectheader"><img src="https://github.com/mOctave/blended-ships/blob/main/icon@2x.png?raw=true" alt="Blended Ships' icon"/><h2>Blended Ships</h2></div><p>Blended Ships is by far my largest and most polished ES plugin, attempting to introduce some element of realism (sorry Azure) into ship splicing.</p></a>
				<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/eratosthenes-benchmark"><div class="projectheader"><h2>Eratosthenes Benchmark</h2></div><p>A 2024 project of mine where I tried to benchmark a number of programming languages and learn a bit more about them in the process. As far as I'm aware, all the code there still should work, and you're welcome to PR another language. However, I'm not actively working on this anymore.</p></a>

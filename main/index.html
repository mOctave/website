		<h1>mOctave</h1>
		<p>Hi! I'm mOctave, an amateur Java developer, Endless Sky reviewer, and ranker of flags. Oh, and I seem to be doing way too much website design these days.</p>
		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>Interested in what I'm doing? Check out some of my projects using the links below:</p>
		<div class="projectcontainer">
			<a class="project" href="https://flagrank.moctave.net"><div class="projectheader"><img src="https://flagrank.moctave.net/img/icon.svg" alt="Flagrank's icon."/><h2>Flagrank</h2></div><p>Have you ever felt personally offended by a bad flag design? Sat down and spent hours of your life trying to build a tier flaglist? Watched that one CGP Grey video on loop? Well, here's the site for you. Pit flags against each other in an infinite series of head-to-head matches and let your (clearly superior) opinions on vexillology influence the flags' online Elo ratings in real time.</p></a>
			<a class="project" href="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky"><div class="projectheader"><img src="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/master/icons/icon_128x128.png?raw=true" alt="Endless Sky's icon"/><h2>Endless Sky</h2></div><p>Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. I do content review for the game when I have time, and also have a number of plugins and development tools for it, a lot of which you'll probably find as you scroll down this page.</p></a>
			<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/weftspace"><div class="projectheader"><img src="https://moctave.github.io/weftspace/icon.svg" alt="Weftspace's icon"/><h2>Weftspace</h2></div><p>Oh look, it's an Endless Sky-related project! Weftspace is a library designed to offer the maximum possible level of support for Endless Sky datafile syntax. Available and maintained for Java and Python, and useful for providing datafile support for lightweight apps where the structure of a JSON or YAML file isn't quite what you're looking for.</p></a>
			<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/blended-ships"><div class="projectheader"><img src="https://github.com/mOctave/blended-ships/blob/main/icon@2x.png?raw=true" alt="Blended Ships' icon"/><h2>Blended Ships</h2></div><p>Blended Ships is by far my largest and most polished ES plugin, attempting to introduce some element of realism (sorry Azure) into ship splicing.</p></a>
			<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/eratosthenes-benchmark"><div class="projectheader"><h2>Eratosthenes Benchmark</h2></div><p>A 2024 project of mine where I tried to benchmark a number of programming languages and learn a bit more about them in the process. As far as I'm aware, all the code there still should work, and you're welcome to PR another language. However, I'm not actively working on this anymore.</p></a>
			<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/mapgen"><div class="projectheader"><h2>Endless Sky Map Generator</h2></div><p>At some point in 2023 I decided that Endless Sky's map needed an update, and so I pieced together a new map out of a whole bunch of screenshots. Fast forward a year and I got fed up with spending so much time doing such repetitive work, and so I made a tool to generate more professional-looking betterer maps automatically.</p></a>
			<a class="project" href="https://github.com/mOctave/grapher"><div class="projectheader"><h2>Grapher</h2></div><p>An exercise in systematic design I put myself through between May 2024 and March 2025. In the end, it turned out to be a working graphing calculator, capable of plotting two different kinds of trendline, custom error bars, and possibly accidentally corrupting your saved files if you look at it the wrong way. I think I'm legally allowed to release it now?</p></a>
			<a class="project" href="https://moctave.github.io/es-community-directory/"><div class="projectheader"><img src="https://moctave.github.io/es-community-directory/img/icon.svg" alt="ES Community Directory' icon"/><h2>ES Community Directory</h2></div><p>One of my recent projects, an attempt to provide a community directory of everyone involved in Endless Sky. Possibly out-of-date by the time you're reading this.</p></a>
